			<h2>What is {{projectTitle}}?</h2>

			<p>
				The aim of {{projectTitle}} is to visualize Nobel prize laureates throughout history, from a geographical point of view and also give the user the oppurtunity to explore laureates down to an individual level.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to give the user the freedom to explore laureates and find new, interesting information. Additionally, we want to give the opportunity to view the Nobel prize laureates in a critical view. We want to shine a light on the patterns of who the average Nobel prize laureate is, where they are from and in what conditions they grew up in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of equality it's an issue that the vast majority of the laureates are people of the same gender and from the same area of the world. Why? There are many answers to this question, and we don't claim to have them all, but we want to highlight this and hopefully be able to show some aspects that can be one of the sources to this inequality.

			<h2>Ideas that did not make it to the project</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Starting with plenty of meetings, the idea of visualizing anything in Virtual Reality was a intriguing to everyone in the group. 
				This would allow a user to stand in three dimensions, exploring and allowing for a much more rich visualization.
				However, after plenty of meetings, the idea was scrapped due to the limit of time and complexity that could introduce bigger problems
				than we expected.</li>
				<br/>
				<li>
				Augmented Reality was another idea that came up for discussion. The idea here was to add a type of cloud representing CO2 emissions
				above an area. This quickly however also was scrapped due to the overwhelming complexity of Augmented Reality and the time it would take.
				</li>
				<br/>
				<li>
				After the idea of using some kind of world map to represent the Nobel Laureates was confirmed, we explored D3 for different ways to visualize
				data. We discussed at first if we would use a <a href="http://xml.csc.kth.se/~thomasvp/DM2517/ivis/nobelity/index.html">simple world map</a>
				,but quickly decided that a much better idea was to use a map in conjunction with a SunBurst graph - which is what we use today for our project.
